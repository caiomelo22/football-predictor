# Football Predictor
This project focuses on predicting football matches using various machine learning models. It's important to note that this is purely a study based on past seasons and is not intended as a financial resource.

## Description
The project is divided in three parts:
- [Simulator](https://github.com/caiomelo22/football-predictor/blob/master/src/simulator.ipynb) --> This notebook was made for you to test your machine learning models and simulate how they would perform in previous seasons. In this notebook you can configure settings such as models features, minimum odds, bankroll and much more. After testing and simulating, you can save your pipeline to make current predictions.
- [Predictor](https://github.com/caiomelo22/football-predictor/blob/master/src/predictor.ipynb) --> The final notebook scrapes and predicts today's football games from a chosen league using the pipelines generated in the previous notebook.

## Setup
To fetch data from your MySQL database, you need to set the following variables in your environment:
```
HOST=localhost
DATABASE=football-db
USER=user
PASSWORD=pwd
```

## Disclaimer
Once again, this project was created for research purposes and should not be considered a means to profit from the sports betting market.
